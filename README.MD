# RetroSpy Server

RetroSpy is a GameSpy Project that aims to create GameSpy 2011/2012 services.

The server is written in C++ and could be considered as the spiritual successor to OpenSpy Core since most of the modules are based from it.

See the [wiki](https://github.com/GameProgressive/RetroSpyServer/wiki) for more information about compiling and creating a RetroSpy Server.
